Data integrity is the overall completeness, accuracy and consistency of data. This can be indicated by the absence of  alteration between two instances or between two updates of a data record’ meaning data is intact and unchanged. Data intrigity is usually imposed during the database design phase through the use standard procedures and rules. The concept of data integrity ensures that all data in a database can be traced and connected to other data.

2.1 DATA DICTIONARY:
A data dictionary contains a list of all files in the database, the number of records in each file, and the names and types of each field . Most database management systems keep the data dictionary hidden from users to prevent them from accidentally destroying its contents.
For most re;ational database management systems(RDBMS), the database management system software needs the data dictionary to access the data within a database. 
For example, the Oracle Database software has to read and write to an Oracle Database. However, it can only do this via the data dictionary created for that particular database.
Table name: Adminlogin_tb
 

Table named : requesterlogin_tb
 
Table name : customer_tb
 

Table name: Asset table
